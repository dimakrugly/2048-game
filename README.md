This code presents a basic rendition of the well-known 2048 game, utilizing solely native JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It adheres to the original game's principles: maneuver numbered tiles across a grid to merge them, aiming to reach a tile displaying the number 2048. The game concludes either when further moves are impossible or when a 2048 tile is successfully generated.
